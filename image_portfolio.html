                <p class="description_text">“Bringing people and plants together” is the ethos of the “Bring a Plant” group, 
                  made immediately clear by the homepage’s image hero with the close-up of two hands holding 
                  a potted plant. The original image most likely had already gone through a degree of manipulation considering 
                  the blurriness surrounding the areas around the plant but I wanted it to have a narrower cut to give more 
                  importance to the hands-plant element. Additionally I aimed for the plant pot to be more defined and the plant’s foliage more vibrant. 
                  Besides, I planned to have the word “welcome”, in white, superimposed on the photo in correspondence with 
                  the hands, so I proceeded to darken the image areas in close proximity to the word for increased 
                  contrast making the text more readable.  
                </p>
                <p class="description_text">PROCESS: I manipulated this image in Photoshop. After opening the original image, 
                  I duplicated it on a new layer and created a clipping path of the potted plant with the pen tool then 
                  deleted all the layer content but the plant through inverse selection and adjusted its vibrance and exposure. 
                  Then, I further blurred the background layer with curves making sure the human body parts would still be 
                  identifiable and the pot's vibrant colours would pop even more. I grouped both background and pot layer 
                  together. In order to give the image its final “leaf shape” I copied the image hero element from the homepage 
                  mockup and pasted it as a smart object into a new layer on Photoshop for reference only. I selected the 
                  transparent areas around the smart object through the magic wand tool, inverted the selection to obtain 
                  the leaf shape and created a mask on the image group. Finally, I added the text with the type tool, 
                  positioned it then converted it into raster to create a soft diffused shadow behind it.</p>
                  <p class="description_text">SAVING AND OPTIMISING FOR THE WEB: if I had to preserve the image transparency 
                    I would have had the option of saving it either in PNG or GIF. However, considering the image is displayed 
                    on white background, I compromised on the alpha channel (that provides transparency) and saved it as JPG, very high,
                     80% quality, converted in sRGB, in order to have a remarkably reduced size compared to its GIF format equivalent.
                    As the original image presents limited range of colours and blurred effect the loss of quality typical of JPEG formats is barely noticeable.</p>

                  Whilst researching on suitable images I was not able to find any representing a group of people and plants 
                  together, so I attempted to recreate my own combining two different images. I intended to use this picture 
                  in the blog section but despite liking the enhanced result, 
                  I think the final image might look too polished for the purpose of the website. 
                </p>
                <p class="description_text">PROCESS: on Photoshop I created a detailed clipping path of the plant pot with the pen tool 
                  on the original image that allowed me to select, cut and insert the plant element into the main picture with the 
                  two women sat at a table with coffee cups. I resized the plant image into a size that would proportionally work 
                  with the other elements and proceeded to adjustthe colours, th lighting and blur the pot's outline to closely match 
                  those in the original image. With the brush tool I painted the shadow at the bottom of the pot, then added 
                  a layer to adjust hue and saturation to blend the result event more.
                  I added a new layer with a very subtle sepia to transparent gradient to further uniform the image elements 
                  and give it a “sunset” feeling. Finally, I cropped the image to its current size excluding part of the 
                  background so the focus would be on the main elements.
                  </p>
                  <p class="description_text">SAVING AND OPTIMISING FOR THE WEB: I saved this image in JPEG, very-high quality at

                  contrast on both the cat’s red fur and the green plants and their coloured pots.

                  menu: I reduced the cold tone of the image modifying the values of the RGB channels with the channel mixer, 
                  increased the exposure, intervened on the image levels, added more contrast, adjusted the colour balance and 
                  improved the image vibrance. Lastly, I reduced the image size.</p>

                  For the homepage I was looking for a striking image that would capture the essence of the group’s 
                  activities and their friendly and welcoming attitude. My solution was to combine monochromatic 
                  images of people and plants into one single picture with the common green hue that tied them all to symbolically represent
                  the core elements of the group.  More in detail, in the web page the image would be composed by a 
                  collection of 15 green monochrome sprites with each one revealing its coloured version when hovering 
                  over it with a mouse. In this instance I have embedded the complete collage image.
                </p>
                <p class="description_text">PROCESS: On Photoshop I set up a custom guide layout of 5 columns and 3 rows. 
                  I determined the size of each image tile (201x213 pixels) and the criteria for the composition by 
                  alternating plant only pictures and images of people’s face or hands. I proceeded to work on every 
                  single image converting the background to layer zero (with added transparency) in order to reduce the canvas in size, 
                  then resized the image dimensions to fit nicely in the canvas. Consequently, 
                  the image mode was changed from RGB to greyscale, its contrast values were adjusted to have higher 
                  variance and the final green hue applied through the selection of the medium and a light shade of 
                  green taken from the mockups colour palette. All tile images where imported into the composition file on 
                  separate layers and aligned using the grid as a guide.</p>
                <p class="description_text">SAVING AND OPTIMISING FOR THE WEB: the image was saved in JPEG format, very high, 80% quality
                  with sRG conversion. The image deterioration is minimal and does not greatly affect the colors, high contrast and the small size of the tile images.</p>

                  This is a vector file entirely drawn on Adobe Illustrator. My goal was to design a simple 
                  playful logo that represented the group’s identity through the combination of typography 
                  and illustrations with similar styles. The vector logo could be reproduced on a number of 
                  printed and digital media and effectively resized  at any size without any quality deterioration.

                <p class="description_text">PROCESS: after a few trials playing with different fonts I chose “Carley Co”, 
                  a skinny all caps font I had already installed in my laptop’s font folder. I amended the letter 
                  spacing and, on a separate layer, I drew the plant pot and leaves illustration with the pen tool 
                  and the circle tool adjusting the path’s angle and curve points with the Bezier handles. 
                  Then I increased the stroke size to match the letters thickness, expanded the plant pot and 
                  2 leaves paths and merged then into one single vector element so the stroke of the illustration 
                  could be proportionally rescaled and finally I expanded the appearance of the font transforming 
                  it into a path, grouped both letters and illustration into one vector on a single layer and changed 
                  its colour to white.</p>
                <p class="description_text">SAVING AND OPTIMISING FOR THE WEB: the vector illustration was exported for the 
                  web directly in Adobe Illustrator and saved in PNG format using the illustrator default settings to 
                  maintain a neat and image with crisp edges on a transparent layer that would make it suitable to be 
                  superimposed on other contrasting coloured  elements such as green background on the final image.</p>
